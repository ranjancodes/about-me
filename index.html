    <p>Hi! My name is Rishav Ranjan.</p>
    <p>I am currently learning programming, and this is what I can create. Yes, I am a noob.</p>
    <p>As of now, I can only create basic HTML pages. However, I know Java and can solve basic DSA questions.</p>
    <p>While I am learning Data Structures and Algorithms, I don't know how that stuff helps in real development. I guess, as of now, I can only count the number of questions that I solved on various platforms.</p>
    <p>A little bit more about me. I used to work as a freelance web (WordPress) developer and did some SEO work alongside website creation. Later, I decided to create my own website.</p>
    <p>I did create one with my friends, and within 2-3 months, it started getting some views. At that point, I dropped freelancing and focused only on growing the site's audience. That website is called <a href="https://www.theunfolder.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Unfolder</a> and now it gets close to a million views every month.</p> 
    <p>My hobbies are (not permanent and they change every month) observing markets and following a few tech stocks. I also like to follow the cryptocurrency space. Aside from that, I watch anime and read manga. You can see my MAL <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/rishavranjan" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
